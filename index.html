<body onload="getWeather()">

    <div>The API I selected is for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, and holds
         descriptions for lots of things from the game.</div>
    <div>I found this from https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis, although
         I knew it exisited from other places.</div>
    <div>I used the asynchronous option for open, since I thought it was more
         important to display something on the page immediately rather than
         waiting for the api request to display anything. Otherwise, I just
         checked that the request was finished and that the response code was
         200 to ensure that it was properly accessed.</div>
    <div>I use an app that lets you make a spell list for your character and
         lets you search for spell descriptions so you don't have to search
         through the 300 page rule book to find the range of a spell or something
         like that. A second use might be to make a searchable list of magic items
         like https://donjon.bin.sh/5e/magic_items/ does. In general, this helps
         to take things that are spread out through lots of books and pages and
         make them searchable.</div>
